# ProductGraphQL
This is a mini GraphQL API project built on .NET 6.0 using C# 10 syntaxes. This API includes endpoints that persist and fetches list on products from an in-memory datastore. The project is targeted to have basic understanding of how GraphQL.NET works and how it differs from REST.

The structure of this project is minimal and it consists of four (4) files in the Models folder including ProductType.cs, ProductSchema, ProductQuery.cs, and Product.cs.
This Project uses the Minimal API structure to route HTTP request to the Implementation layers directly.
